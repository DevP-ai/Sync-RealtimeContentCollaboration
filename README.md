## Open to Contributors
I and We warmly welcome contributors to contribute to this app and improve the App, add new features and more, especially the Jetpack compose UI part. 

### Technologies used:
1. Language: Kotlin
2. UI: Jetpack Compose ( I am a noob in it :), so don't mind my code.)
3. Realtime signals: Firebase Realtime Db.
4. Architecture: MVVM + Clean Architecture
5. AI: Open AI Chat GPT Api

#### Note: In order to setup the environment and work on the app locally, you've to add the firebase db url, Open AI Api & other credentials in values/string files, i know it's not a good approach to save keys this way, but it is what it is :))
